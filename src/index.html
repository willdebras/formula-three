            <h1>IMPROVED FRONT WING</h1>
            <p>The 2022 car features a new and improved front wing that will help generate consistent downforce when following another car.
                This will correctly re-direct incoming air away from the undercarriage and streamline it around the car.</p>

            <h1>PIRELLI 18IN. TYRES</h1>
            <p>2022 regulations added larger wheels and tyres with an overall lower profile.
                These changes will reduce overheating of tyres when they slide, 
                which should help track conditions when racers are close together.</p>

    <section id="section3"  class="section">
        <div>
            <h1>ROLLED REAR</h1>
            <p>The new rear wing features rolled tips creating a cyclonic airflow upward, letting following drivers drive through
                cleaner, less disrupted air.</p>

            <h1>WHEEL IMPROVEMENTS</h1>
            <p>The 2022 car features a return of wheel covers and the addition of over-wheel winglets 
                that will reduce the chaotic air wake coming from a car's wheels.
                This change will make conditions better for following cars.</p>

            <h1>SUSTAINABLE FUEL</h1>
            <p>While the power unit remains the 1.6 litre, turbo-hybrids of the 2021 season, the cars will consume a new E10 fuel,
                meaning the fuel will be composed of 10% bio-components.</p>
